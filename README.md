## Overview

This is a basic dupe of Fruit Ninja, in the classic game mode. The mouse would control the blade by dragging, and different fruit images could be imported (e.g. bananas, watermelons, mangoes, peaches, pineapples, coconuts, kiwis, lemons): they would be thrown up and fall according to basic Processing physics, with gravity and maybe some rotation on the way up and down. When split, the fruits would be halved, and there would be a score counter that goes up. Most fruits will also leave a colored splatter on the brick wall behind them when they are split. Each fruit will be a separate class and can behave differently in terms of physics, splitting, and splattering. Also, there will be a bomb class: when the user slices the bomb (or clicks on it, or goes over the bomb when the mouse is down), the game will end at whatever score it is. Another way the game could end is by a strike counter. The strikes will be shown on the top left and will be represented by X’s - when all three X’s are red (when the user misses three fruits), the game will end. The start menu will have a text logo and a play button. During the game, there will be a pause button that freezes the game until the user presses play again. At the end of the game, there will be a box displaying the player’s score and a replay button.

## Instructions
Press any key to start the game. Slice the fruits when they come onto the screen by dragging and clicking your mouse across them. If you miss enough, the game ends. If you slice anough and reach the goal score, you win. Don't click the bombs.
