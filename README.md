## Overview


This project is a basic implementation of the classic Fruit Ninja game, featuring a variety of fruit images such as bananas, watermelons, mangoes, peaches, pineapples, coconuts, kiwis, and lemons. The game is controlled by dragging the mouse to simulate slicing fruits with a blade. Fruits are thrown into the air and fall back down according to basic physics, incorporating gravity and rotation. When sliced, fruits split into halves and produce colored splatters on the background, enhancing the visual feedback. The game includes a score counter that increments with each successfully sliced fruit. Each fruit type is represented by a separate class, allowing for distinct behaviors in terms of physics, splitting, and splattering effects. Additionally, a bomb class is implemented; slicing a bomb ends the game immediately, regardless of the current score.
The main classes in this project include the FruitNinja class, which manages the game state, the UFO class, which handles the physics and movement of objects, the Fruit class, which extends UFO to include specific fruit behaviors, and the Half class, which represents the split halves of fruits. The game also features a strike counter displayed as Xâ€™s on the top left; missing three fruits ends the game. The start menu displays a logo and a play button, while a pause button allows players to freeze the game. At the end of the game, a score display and replay button are presented, providing a complete and engaging user experience.

## Instructions
Slice the rotating watermelon that appears at the beginning to start the game. Slice the fruits when they come onto the screen by dragging and clicking your mouse across them. If you miss 3 fruits, the game ends. If you slice 10 fruits, you win. You lose if you slice a bomb. To pause the game, click the pause button. To replay, click the replay button (when prompted). To pause the game, click the pause button at the top right. You can click the replay button in the center or the play button at the top right from this menu.

Shortcuts:

press the 'e' button on your keyboard to see the lose screen.

press the 'w' button on your keyboard to see the win screen.
