# Work Log

## GROUP MEMBER 1 - Alice

### 5/22/24

In class: Added basic method and field names into all class according to the prototype, started setup and draw.

### 5/23/24

In class: Uploaded images, started with basic methods "skeleton"

### 5/24/24

(had AP Calc exam)
At home: debugged UFO physics (specifically attractto and move) so that it makes more sense with the game

### 5/25/24

Fixed up setup method; also changed up the approach for physics methods in UFO, which simplifies the logic

### 5/26/24

Added rotational motion to the UFO class so that fruits rotate as they move, including variables and methods. Drawing would also apply rotation.

### 5/27/24

Made fruits start at a randomized speed, and made adjustments so that the score would change OR the game ended if the mouse was dragged over certain things (seems a little buggy)

### 5/28/24

Made fruits start at a random location, made some adjustments for player convenience/visibility, fixed a bug with endGame() and replay, and made mouseDragged() not end the game due to an error.

## 5/29/24

Worked on a splatter shape for the fruits, and worked on making splatter a compatible method with all fruits, depending on the color.

## GROUP MEMBER 2 - Eva

### 5/23/24

In class: I made an arraylist to make the watermelon show up and displayed it successfully.
At home: Randomized which fruit is generated, added correct image files, and made the fruits move in keyPressed() by changing the x and y values with new methods. 

### 5/24/24

In class: I updated the image files to have better resolution and began writing the physics simulation, based on Orb lab. Might switch to a new calculation based on projectile motion though. 

### 5/26/24
At home: designed and implemented a simpler approach to the physics: projectile motion. 

### 5/28/24
In class: worked on splatter in class, tried to use a boolean to display it.
At home: implemented basic correct default splatter! decided to use an arraylist to store PVectors instead

### 5/29/24
In class: got more correct splatter to work, utilizing the classes instead of doing it in main.
At home: Finished splatter and added a different colored one to each class. 

### 5/30/24
In class: Made fruits randomly generate and move. Don't use keypressed anymore, just generates immediately.
