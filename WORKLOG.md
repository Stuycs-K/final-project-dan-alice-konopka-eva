# Work Log

## GROUP MEMBER 1 - Alice

### 05/22/24

In class: Added basic method and field names into all class according to the prototype, started setup and draw.

### 05/23/24

In class: Uploaded images, started with basic methods "skeleton"

### 05/24/24

(had AP Calc exam)
At home: debugged UFO physics (specifically attractto and move) so that it makes more sense with the game

### 5/25/24

Fixed up setup method; also changed up the approach for physics methods in UFO, which simplifies the logic


## GROUP MEMBER 2 - Eva

### 5/23/24

In class: I made an arraylist to make the watermelon show up and displayed it successfully.
At home: Randomized which fruit is generated, added correct image files, and made the fruits move in keyPressed() by changing the x and y values with new methods. 

### 5/24/24

In class: I updated the image files to have better resolution and began writing the physics simulation, based on Orb lab. Might switch to a new calculation based on projectile motion though. 

5/26/24
At home: designed and implemented a simpler approach to the physics: projectile motion.
